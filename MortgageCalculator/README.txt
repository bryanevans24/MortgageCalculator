I saw a need for mobile mortgage calculator that I could use while house hunting. 

So I built this simple app to coorespond to what I have been learning in C#, SQL and web design.

In its current state this is a console app that connects to a database that can save a user name and the users searches.

The web and mobile verison are in the works and will be released later.

This mortgage calculator will take in all the inputs to calculate a mortgage, including home owners insurance and taxes. 

The user can then save their search and add their address and city to then recall their previous searches at a later time.

Thank you for taking the time to look at my passion project and enjoy!
